## How to contribute to Letsproxy

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in 3rd party components**, and instead open an issue in appropriate project.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/rmamba/letsproxy/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/rmamba/letsproxy/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Letsproxy will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open an issue on GitHub to check for interest. Features with higher interest and/or from our sponsors generally have higher priority.

Letsproxy is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in!
